<p>For my first blog post, I'd like to introduce myself, and give you an overview of what to expect on this blog.
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Nick Tasios. My mother is Dutch/Italian and my father Greek. Due to this, I grew up in a bilingual environment; my parents spoke English to each other, and I spoke Dutch with my mother and Greek with my father. From early on, I had a lot of curiosity. Whenever my parents were not home, I would open up electronic appliances, and mix different kinds of materials into ugly concoctions.</p>
<p>One of my earliest fascinations, were of course video games. Growing up in the early 90s, computers and game consoles were booming. I think I played my first video games at friends' houses when I was 5. I begged my father to get us a computer, until he finally got one when I was 6. The day after he got the computer, I woke up and immediately went to check I was not dreaming. Early on, I couldn't do a lot. My father wrote me a list of commands I could type in DOS, and every now and then, I would mess up and I would call my father at work to help me out. This was a recurring theme for many years to come; I would mess something up, and if I was not able to fix it, my father would have to clean up my mess. But that's how I learned computers, i.e. with trial and error.</p>
<p>I was introduced to programming for the first time when I was about 11 years old, by a school teacher that normally taught us geography. I was fascinated! I remember typing some programs in Basic, and learning about the hexadecimal system. Unfortunately, back then, I didn't think of programming at home, my parents allowed me to sit behind the computer for a limited amount every day, so I rather preferred playing games. It was not until I was 16 that I started programming a bit more seriously. I got back into programming when I got a Sony PlayStation 2. The first few models that shipped in Europe, came with a demo disc which included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yabasic">YaBasic</a>, a version of Basic. I didn't have a keyboard for the PS2, so typed everything painfully slow by using the controller.</p>
<p>At school, two of my favorite subjects were physics and mathematics. I even participated at some math contests, but these usually tested math material from later years, so although I could solve some problems using logic and my knowledge, I couldn't get very far. Logically, when it was time came to pick a subject to study at University, I knew I had to choose between physics and mathematics. You might ask, 'why not computer science?', and my idea back then was that I could learn computer science on my own, physics and mathematics are a bit harder. In the end I chose physics as I thought it would give me more career options down the line.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, after I graduated, I went on to do a MSc in theoretical physics in the Netherlands. As I was getting really into programming, I chose Prof. Dr. Marjolein Dijkstra as my supervisor and studied various systems in soft matter, using computer simulations. After 4 years I had also completed a PhD with the same supervisor. During this time I fell in love with graphics/game engine programming, so it seemed logical to me to pursuit a career in this direction. Unfortunately, the reality is that few game studios develop their own game engines, and even fewer would hire someone with no actual experience in field. I also realized that turning your hobby into a job, means you lose your hobby.</p>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>My introduction should have already hinted on the type of subjects to expect here. To gain more experience in game programming, I intend to clone some well known video games and blog about the process. Beyond game programming, you should also expect posts about code optimization, visualization, and data analysis. I'm also a very opinionated programmer, so expect some posts on programming best practices! My favourite programming languages are C/C++ and Rust, Python for scripting and prototyping, and Haskell for thinking out of the box!</p>
<p>As this is a static website, I have no comments enabled. If you'd like me to blog about something specific, or you have any other comments, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:nicktasios@gmail.com">nicktasios@gmail.com</a>. I hope you enjoy the posts!</p>
