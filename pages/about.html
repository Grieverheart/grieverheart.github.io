        Hi, I'm Nick Tasios. I have a PhD in physics and like making computers do fancy stuff. As I like to say, my curiosity led me to become a physicist, and my creativity and drive to build things led me to programming.

        I like to tackle challenging problems and come up with creative solutions. As I love working on a multitude of things, from graphics programming to neural networks, I see myself, not as a specialist, but as an expert generalist. Being a generalist has its own benefits and drawbacks, but I like it very much.
